# 👋 Hi, I’m Juan David Caballero Barros (ju4ncb)!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a systems engineer student passionate about web development and artificial intelligence (machine learning). My journey began with Java, mastering OOP and data structures, and has since expanded into Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and beyond. I thrive on building web, mobile and desktop software, and exploring new technologies every semester break, so expect to have more here in a few months!

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, R, Bash, SASS, SQL, NoSQL, (and a bit of PHP)
- **Frontend:** React (HOCs, custom hooks, contexts, forms, router), Angular, Electron, HTML/CSS/JS, SASS, Figma, Balsamiq, WordPress
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (JWT, sessions, passport, CORS, cookies), MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, REST API design, FastAPI, Flask, PyQt, Tkinter
- **Machine Learning:** Regression, classification, neural networks, reinforcement learning, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Xarray, Jupyter
- **DevOps/Cloud:** Docker, AWS Lambda, Firebase, Railway, Vercel, Netlify
- **Networking:** Network design (Cisco), server management (FTP, HTTP, SSH, DHCP, DNS protocols on Linux Mint & Windows Server 2022)
- **Other:** SCRUM/agile, Slack, OOP & functional programming (across languages)

## 💡 What I Do

- Build robust web apps & APIs (SPAs, backends, desktop and mobile apps, my main occupation)
- Develop and deploy machine learning models (regression, classification, neural networks, RL)
- Design databases (relational & NoSQL), advanced queries, and network architectures
- Lead teams and projects in college

## 🌟 Featured Projects

- [**themis**](https://github.com/ju4ncb/themis): The most recent (and best) college project I've taken a lead on. This is a platform that allows any person to create, evaluate y understand AI models and data analysis in a simple and intuitive way.
- [**h2esperanza**](https://github.com/ju4ncb/h2o): Another college project that I've led. It's another platform, but this one is a game that brings knowledge to the user about the ODS 6, and why water and sanitation is an important aspect to develop as a society.

## 🎸 Fun Facts

- I love music and play guitar as a hobby
- Chess enthusiast (occasional player)
- Fluent in Spanish & English

## 🧑‍💻 Always Learning

I've been a leader or team representative in (almost) every college project I've come across, and I pick up new technologies every semester break (and sometimes in between semesters). You can revisit my profile in a few years to see how it has evolved.
